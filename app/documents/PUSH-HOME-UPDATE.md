# Push Home Page Update to GitHub

I've updated the home page (`app/page.tsx`) to automatically redirect to Paper 1, providing a better user experience. This change will make Paper 1 the landing page when visiting https://ecosystem-2.vercel.app/.

## How to Push the Change

### Option 1: Using VS Code Source Control

1. Open VS Code Source Control tab (sidebar or press Ctrl+Shift+G)
2. You'll see the modified file (`app/page.tsx`) listed
3. Click the + button next to the file to stage it
4. Enter a commit message: "Update home page to redirect to Paper 1"
5. Click the checkmark (✓) to commit
6. Click the sync/push button (↑) to push to GitHub

### Option 2: Using a Terminal Command

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Stage the modified file
git add app/page.tsx

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Update home page to redirect to Paper 1"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

### Option 3: Using the Existing github-push Script

If you have a working github-push.bat or github-push.sh file, you can run it:

```
# For Windows
.\github-push.bat

# For WSL
./github-push.sh
```

## What Happens Next

Once you push this change:

1. GitHub will receive the updated code
2. Vercel will automatically detect the change
3. Vercel will build and deploy the updated site
4. After deployment (usually takes 1-2 minutes), the homepage at https://ecosystem-2.vercel.app/ will redirect to Paper 1

This change completes the UI improvement by making Paper 1 the landing page, as you requested.
