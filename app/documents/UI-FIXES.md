# UB Reader UI Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Section Link Overshooting

**Problem:** When clicking on "Section 2" from the dropdown menu, it would overshoot the actual section by a couple of lines.

**Solution:**

- Added `scroll-padding-top: 150px` to the reading area
- Added `scroll-margin-top: 150px` to section titles
- These CSS properties ensure the browser considers the sticky headers when scrolling to anchor links

### 2. Incorrect Sticky Section Title

**Problem:** When scrolling the page, the sticky "Section 2" label would appear at paragraph 2, not at section 2.

**Solution:**

- Completely rewrote the section detection algorithm
- Now uses a more sophisticated visibility calculation that:
  - Measures how much of each section is visible in the viewport
  - Gives bonus points to sections closer to the top of the viewport
  - Selects the section with the highest visibility score
- Added an initial scroll event trigger to set the correct section on page load

### 3. Dropdown Menu Disappearing Too Quickly

**Problem:** The hover behavior on the section dropdown was problematic, disappearing before you could select a section.

**Solution:**

- Replaced pure CSS hover with JavaScript-controlled show/hide
- Added a 500ms delay before hiding the dropdown when mouse leaves
- Implemented click-based toggling for the dropdown button
- Added event stopping to prevent dropdown from closing when clicking inside it
- Made dropdown items larger and added padding for easier targeting on mobile

## How to Use the Fixed Version

1. The improved version has been saved as `improved-demo.html`
2. This file replaces the previous version with the same fixes deployed
3. To test the fix, try the following actions:
   - Click "Jump to Section" and select "2. The Reality of God" - it should now scroll perfectly to that section
   - Scroll slowly through the text and watch the sticky section title - it should now correctly show the current section
   - Try using the section dropdown menu - it should stay open until you've made a selection
