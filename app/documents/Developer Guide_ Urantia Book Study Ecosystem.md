# Developer Guide: Urantia Book Study Ecosystem

## 1. Introduction

The Urantia Book Study Ecosystem is a comprehensive digital platform designed to enhance the study and exploration of The Urantia Book. This ecosystem comprises four integrated applications:

1. UB Reader
2. Almanac
3. Content Management System (CMS)
4. Urantia Book AI (UBAI)

Our development approach follows a phased implementation:

1. UB Reader as the core application
2. Almanac integration
3. CMS implementation
4. UBAI development

This guide focuses primarily on the UB Reader, which serves as the foundation for the entire ecosystem.

## 2. Development Priorities

- **Responsive Design:** Ensure full functionality across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Accessibility:** Achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, including proper use of ARIA attributes.
- **Performance:** Optimize all assets for fast loading and smooth operation.
- **Offline Capability:** Ensure core functionality is available without an internet connection.


## 3. UB Reader Specifications

### Core Principles
